<p><FONT SIZE=+1>27 Nov - 7 Dec 2015,  Raja Ampat, West Papua <br>
-------------------------------------------<br>
<FONT SIZE=+0><b>Geography refresher. That large island called New Guinea at the eastern end of Indonesia is politically split in two; eastern half now called Papua New Guinea, while the western Indonesian half is again split in two,  Papua (was Irian Jaya), and West Papua.  Raja Ampat refers to the region of four large islands off the western end of West Papua. This coral triangle has the greatest marine biodiversity in the world. A fee of 1,000,000 Rupiah (currently about $77) is required of all forigners who enter the area. Indonesians must also pay a 500,000 Rupiah fee.</b><br>

<td>We left Bangkok about 6pm Friday, arrived in the Jakarta terminal almost 10 pm, left at 1:30 am for Ambon, arriving at 7am. 5.5 hours later we take the final flight leg to Sorong. We will have only minutes to pick up our luggage, hire a vehicle, and make our way to the port where the Waisai Ferry is about to leave -- only ferry today. As luck would have it, the sim card worked wonders. We frantically texted our buddies, already on the ferry, with updates of our exact location -- to try to hold the ferry for us -- we are rushing as fast as possible. The captain DID hold the ferry for us! That saved us a lot of money in boat hires and an expensive night in Sorong.

<p>In Waisai, we met the homestay boat for our final leg of the journey, arriving at dusk Saturday. 24 hours of travel, 36 hours with no sleep. Dinner was served at 8, and I crashed about 9. Accomodations were two per Nipa hut, built on stilts over the water. Toilets and showers were a 3-4 minute walk in-land. The dining room was were everyone congregated. The generators were started up at disk and turned off between 10 and 11. 

<p>I had no experience taking photos underwater. The throw-away film ones were a joke. A decent camera is pretty specialized, and a good one runs into considerable expense. But while in Bangkok, I decided to look around again. One camera store at Pantip plaza said there is a cheap knock-off of a Go-Pro cam, called an SJ Cam. Takes both video and 12MB stills, no optical zoom. For just over $100, the pachage includes an underwater housing and a host of attachments for mounting to bicycles, motorcycles, dash boards, and various orientation adapters.  Uses 32 GB microSD card. Bought a spare battery too.

<p>Took three or four days before I started getting acceptable pictures with it. Never been one for shooting videos, but made an exception this time. Next problem -- how to use video editing software! 

In the mean time, take a look at these stills during the last several days at Raja Ampat.
