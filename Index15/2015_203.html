<p><FONT SIZE=+1>Dec 23, 2015, George Town, Penang Island, Malaysia<FONT SIZE=+0><br>
<FONT SIZE=+0><b>-------------------------------------------<br>
Flew from Bali to Singapore and hopped a bus to Johor Bahru, Malaysia. These places have really changed since my last visit; did not recognize anything, and could not find my old guest house. Heard there was flooding on the Malay East Coast, so tried to take a train up the west coast. All fully booked for the next 10 days! So, bought a bus ticket a day later as far up the west coast as possible; the capitol, Kuala Lumpur. That bus station has been moved out to the boonies, so had to take a couple of commuter trains to get to the backpacker region in city center. Found a great shop for silk batik shirts, but not in my size. After a great meal and good night's rest, commuted back to the bus station and continued on to Lumut, jumping off place for ferries to Pulau Pangkor. Visited the Malaysia Tourist Information office, and discovered my old haunt has changed management, and was essentially booked for the week. Weather didn't look so good, so booked a bus for Penang, leaving the next morning.<br>

<TD align="left"></FONT>Found a map showing the locations of a lot of the street art in George Town, so next project is to take photos of much of it in this city on Penang Island. The map itemizes the iron rod art by number, and the paintings by letter, so using the same index scheme will minimize confusion.
