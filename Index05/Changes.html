<FONT SIZE=+1><p align="right">January 17, 2006</p><P align="left">Hi Folks,</P>

<P>Changes. Spent some time trying to update my web site from Bangkok, and found it easier than I ever expected. That's the good news. That prompts me to stop sending photos via email, which had really been causing problems with spam catchers and overloaded mailboxes. Instead, I will try to update the web site weekly. Recently added are special topics covering Transportation, Bamboo home construction, and 8th - 13th century ruins of civilizations in Southeast Asia. Someone new want to follow my travels? Simple. Just tell them to go to my web site:  www.Trav-E-Log.org  Before long, even all text will be there as well.</P>

<P>Email has been more problematic, as my ISP went belly up, and using the email associated with my web address just doesn't seem to work. Please continue using the Juno address, Dancer2SEAsia.</P>

<P>I sincerly hope everyone is having a great time, and developing an urge to get out and travel.</P>
