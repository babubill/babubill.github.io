Hi Folks,<pre><b><i>=================================
Certainly hope I can safely travel to this troubled country. My Indonesian Visa
expires on 20 Jan, 2007, so plans are to be in Timor Barat (West Timor) about 5
days earlier. If the border is closed, I'll have to fly out of Indonesia.

<td vALIGN="top"><font size=+1><p>The Portuguese began to trade with the island of Timor in the early 16th century and colonized it in mid-century. Skirmishing with the Dutch in the region eventually resulted in an 1859 treaty in which Portugal ceded the western portion of the island. Imperial Japan occupied East Timor from 1942 to 1945, but Portugal resumed colonial authority after the Japanese defeat in World War II. East Timor declared itself independent from Portugal on 28 November 1975 and was invaded and occupied by Indonesian forces nine days later. It was incorporated into Indonesia in July 1976 as the province of East Timor. An unsuccessful campaign of pacification followed over the next two decades, during which an estimated 100,000 to 250,000 individuals lost their lives. On 30 August 1999, in a UN-supervised popular referendum, an overwhelming majority of the people of East Timor voted for independence from Indonesia. Between the referendum and the arrival of a multinational peacekeeping force in late September 1999, anti-independence Timorese militias - organized and supported by the Indonesian military - commenced a large-scale, scorched-earth campaign of retribution. The militias killed approximately 1,400 Timorese and forcibly pushed 300,000 people into West Timor as refugees. The majority of the country's infrastructure, including homes, irrigation systems, water supply systems, and schools, and nearly 100% of the country's electrical grid were destroyed. On 20 September 1999 the Australian-led peacekeeping troops of the International Force for East Timor (INTERFET) deployed to the country and brought the violence to an end. On 20 May 2002, East Timor was internationally recognized as an independent state.</p>

<p>Ninety percent of Timorese are Roman Catholic. 

<p>The area of Timor Leste is 15,007 sq km -- slightly larger than Connecticut. Highest point is Foho Tatamailau, 2,963 m. Natural resources include gold, petroleum, natural gas, manganese, and marble. It is the largest and easternmost of the Lesser Sunda Islands. 

<p align=left>
<ol>What are your Top 5 things to see or do in East Timor?

<li> Mt Ramelau, the highest point on the whole island (East and West Timor) - from the top you can see both coasts
<li> Coming back from Atauro Island after a diving trip - with great frequency you encounter dolphins and pilot whales
<li> Baucau and the laid-back Portuguese flavour of the Pousada de Baucau
<li> The amazing views from the cliff tops at Tutuala at the eastern end of the island
<li> Just travelling around; there's a feeling that you're going somewhere that hasn't had many visitors yet.</ol>

<p>But then there is this November 01, 2006 travel warning from the US Department of State:

<ul><i>This Travel Warning is being updated to inform Americans of ongoing security concerns in East Timor and to urge American citizens to defer non-essential travel to East Timor at this time.  This supersedes the Travel Warning issued on July 18, 2006.

<p>Although the Department of State authorized lifting the ordered departure status of the U.S. Embassy in Dili on July 18, the Department remains concerned by the threat to the personal safety of Americans in East Timor due to continued indiscriminate communal and politically motivated violence, particularly in the capital, Dili.  American citizens are urged to defer non-essential travel to East Timor.  Demonstrations in response to the dismissal of 595 members of the armed forces escalated into rioting and violence in April and May.  The presence of international troops and police beginning in late May has improved the security situation.  However, an upsurge in violence in late October resulted in the deaths of several people, and a number of serious security concerns remain, including:<p>

<li>  The international airport was closed on October 25 due to violent disturbances in its vicinity.  The airport has returned to normal operations and security has been augmented.  However, travelers who do not defer travel to East Timor should check the status of flights and security in the area prior to commencing travel.
<li>  There are continued incidents of gang related violence in Dili and an associated risk to Americans being intentionally or inadvertently injured by such violence.  Stone-throwing attacks on cars are frequent, and have affected American citizens on several occasions.  The beach road running from the harbor to beyond the U.S. Embassy has become particularly prone to stone throwing at vehicles.  Americans who travel to East Timor despite this warning should exercise extreme caution and maintain a high level of security awareness while moving about in Dili.
<li>  Several areas of Dili have become sites of chronic security incidents.  These include in particular the areas around the camps for internally displaced people (IDPs).  Americans are advised to avoid these areas and check with the U.S. Embassy regarding other areas of concern.
<li>  The Government of Australia has revised its travel advice for East Timor to include a warning that Australians and Australian interests may be targeted.  There is a risk that such targeting could encompass foreigners indiscriminately, including Americans.  The Australian travel advice can be viewed at http://www.smartraveller.gov.au/zw-cgi/view/Advice/East_Timor
<li>  Sexual assaults against foreign nationals have occurred and may increase in the current environment.  Female travelers are advised to exercise particular caution and to avoid travel alone on foot or in taxis, especially at night and in unfamiliar or isolated areas. 
<li>   There have been illegal checkpoints operated in some areas of the city. Most frequently taxis and minibuses are stopped with the intent of extortion; in some cases East Timorese were identified for more violent targeting.  American citizens are advised against using taxis or minibuses for transportation....</i></ul>
