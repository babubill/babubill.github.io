Hi Folks,<pre><b><i>=================================
Arrived at the port of Mura on Sunday at 4 PM, and changed enough 
Malaysian Ringat to take the waiting bus into town. The money changers at 
this port are notorious for giving a bad exchange rate, so my plans are to 
get a cash advance in town. First mistake.

<p>From the bus terminal in Bandar Seri Begawan (BSB), walked up to the Pusat Belia -- the Youth Hostel. Found the office empty, so walked all over the hostel, finally finding the resident manager playing games inside the pool house. He told me to go back up to the office, and he would meet me there in 5 minutes.

<p>The good news was that even someone my age can stay here, and that he would accept Malaysian Ringat or Brunei Dollars for payment. When asking about a bank, he informed me that the banks, all back near the bus station, were closed both today and tomorrow for Israj Miraj, a Muslim Holiday celebrated only in Brunei. What's more, most places in country will be closed. Exceptions would be transportation, food, and construction workers.  I still needed to acquire local curency or go hungry, so headed to a hotel lobby, where a very unfavorable rate had to be used.

</p>Spent the rest of the day and all the next walking around the town and checking out many of the elevated walk ways in this, the Venice of the East. Also took a bus out to the New Mosque, as it is on the tourist track. Removing my shoes at the entrance is second nature, but I asked if any other restrictions. No. Walked 20 feet over to a nicely designed staircase, pulled out my camera, and had three people decend on me saying "no foto". Second mistake. I wished them salam alecom, left, and didn't turn back.
