Hi Folks,<i><b><pre><FONT SIZE=+2>
=================================
This is the final page of one backpacker's missives in Southeast Asia from 
April to September 2003. Traveling is fun, educational, and an experience
one never forgets. My belief is that as international travel increases, the
more difficult it will be for governments to wage war. 

I traveled with a backpack, a daysack, a waist sack, and a passport pouch
hung around the neck under my shirt. Here are the contents (less gifts)
upon return.
