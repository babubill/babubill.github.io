<p><i>If you are planning an inexpensive trip, here are some of my thoughts for this part of the world.
Modify to suit your own personality.  And please put me on distribution for your travelogue!</i>

<p>============== GLAD I HAD THESE ITEMS =============

<img SRC="ImageBackpack/BackPack.jpg" ALT="Vinson 55 liter pack by Invicta." BORDER=0 height=294 width=190 align="RIGHT">

<ul>
<li>
Nylon shell jacket, in pouch.</li>

<li>
Pocket language phrase books and dictionary. (Smaller is better.)</li>

<li>
Snorkel fins and mask to fit my face,  and medium size bath towel.</li>

<li>
Spare bathing suit, long sleeve tee and pants for sun protection in water.</li>

<li>
Aqua socks or Speedo "Surf Walker" with heel cups for arch support.</li>

<li>
Knife-fork-spoon and very sharp paring knife in pouch.</li>

<li>
One cotton and one silk sleeping bag liners.</li>

<li>
Compact binoculars. </li>

<li>
Point and shoot digital camera with optical zoom, tripod, spare battery. 

<li>
220-volt, 4-watt LED light bulb for reading.  (<a href="https://www.quantumbalancing.com/worldelectricity/electricityif.htm" target="_blank">See: World Electricity Standards)</a></li>

<li>
Laundry bag. Clothes line and several eye bolts. Several small clothes pegs.</li>

<li>
Small towel for cleaning. Store damp in zip lock bag in the day sack.</li>

<li>
Dual-SIM cell phone, spare battery. Purchase cheap SIM card as you enter new country.</li>

<li>
A 13-inch netbook with SSD, + large external hard drive.</li>

<li>
A high quality, rugged backpack, only half full upon departure (see image).</li>

<li>
A rugged day sack.</li>

<li>
Convertible pants -- zip off the legs and they become shorts. Especially great for overly air-conditioned buses.</li>

<li>
A bee-keepers hat to keep insects at bay while sleeping. (Mosquito netting is too bulky, and the coils are not a healthy long-term solution.) An Army-Navy store sold me the netting which I attached to a canvas safari hat.</li>

<li>
Bought a 12MP SJCam w/underwater case and spare battery for under $100 in Thailand.</li>

<li>
Cable ties to secure pack closures. (Slows the petty thief, not the professional.)</li>
</ul>
<p>============== THINGS TO LEAVE HOME ==============
<ul>
<li>
Bulky items such as sleeping bag, mattress.</li>

<li>
Jeans, dress shirt (other than flight clothing). If needed during trip, buy.</li>

<li>
Valuables, such as expensive watches, jewelry, expensive camera, laptop.</li>

<li>
Pots, pans, stove, fuel. (Fruit is cheap, and always in season).</li>

<li>
Travel guides with nice photos -- just too heavy. Consider Lonely Planet digital version.</li>

<li>
Water bottles -- just buy bottled water in size to fit the side pockets on your pack, and then refill.</li>

<li>
Deodorant, shave cream, shampoo -- use plain bar soap.</li>
</ul>

<p>===================== VISAs  ====================
<br>Visa requirements change: Some countries offer Visa exempt stutus to travelers from selet countries -- show up at the immigration booth, your passport is examined/stamped for 14 to 60 days travel -- no cost. Other countries require many details in advance such as date of arrival. Your visa will ONLY be for the (~30 day) period starting on that date!  Fees also vary depending on passport country. Obtaining a visa in person at a counsulate may be the cheapest approach, but making a mistake can be costly. Finding a reliable visa agent may save you time, and in some rare cases, money too. 

<p>============= DISCUSSION and POINTERS =============
<br>Postage rates change: Malaysia was cheapest, now most expensive. Singapore cheapest, but Thailand fastest. 
<br>Ask for better currency exchange rates for bills and (American Express) traveler's checks of larger demonination (i.e. US $50, $100).
<br>IMPORTANT: ONLY CARRY THE MOST RECENTLY ISSUED CURRENCY! 

<p>============== THE PELNI EXPERIENCE ==============
<br>Try to obtain a Pelni Schedule before arriving in Indonesia -- most helpful for long-range planning. The schedule gives sailing times for each ship, as well as interruptions for overhaul. Pelni has a web site (<a href="http://www.pelni.co.id">www.pelni.co.id</a>) -- hopefully it will expand to show more schedule details.

<br>Their are six classes of Pelni offices; ranging from "Cabang A" which can sell tickets for any from/to destination, to "Cabang D" and "Sub Cabang" offices, which are highly restricted in the types of tickets sold.

<br>If you must travel "Ekonomi Kelas", bring food for meals or buy at snack bar on top deck, back of ship. (Food is also sold by vendors plying the decks on some journeys.)&nbsp; Bring ear plugs to use while sleeping (4 am call to prayer), and also while eating in snack bar (loud music).
If traveling alone, make friends immediately for security reasons. You can't watch your backpack while in the bathroom, sleeping, etc. Security is the single most important reason to NOT travel "Ekonomi Kelas".

<p>============== INTERNATIONAL FERRIES =============
<br>The show time is several hours before departure to facilitate passport control (and customs?). My experience is between Dumai and Melaka. Had to surrender passport at the ferry office in town several hours before departure, but then it was returned to me in less than 30 minutes, after which I was free to walk around town for another hour or so. When boarding the ferry, just a cursory look for declarations was made, except for folks obviously carrying commercial items. On the ferry, the passports were again collected for just a short time, then returned. Upon arrival at destination, the passengers just walk off the dock -- all formalities have been completed.

<p>==================== COSTS ====================
<br>After paying for round trip airfare and medical necessities, my budget was $100 per week in 1999. But costs continue to rise, and were double that in 2007. If traveling as a couple, lodging costs will only be slightly less. By spring 2016, this site should update costs again.
