<p><i>If you are planning an inexpensive trip, here are some of my thoughts for this part of the world.
Modify to suit your own personality.  And please put me on distribution for your travelogue!</i>

<p>============== GLAD I HAD THESE ITEMS =============

<img SRC="ImageBackpack/BackPack.jpg" ALT="Vinson 55 liter pack by Invicta." BORDER=0 height=294 width=190 align="RIGHT">

<ul>
<li>
Nylon shell jacket, in pouch.</li>
<li>
Pocket language phrase books and dictionary. (Smaller is better.)</li>
<li>
Snorkel fins and mask to fit my face,  and small bath towel.</li>
<li>
Spare bathing suit, long sleeve tee and cotton pants for sun protection in water.</li>
<li>
Aqua socks or Speedo "Surf Walker" with heel cups for arch support.</li>
<li>
Knife-fork-spoon and very sharp paring knife in pouch.</li>
<li>
One cotton and one silk sleeping bag liners.</li>
<li>
Compact binoculars -- leave the expensive ones at home. </li>
<li>
Point and shoot digital camera with optical zoom, tripod, spare battery. 
<li>
220-volt, 4-watt LED light bulb for reading. Some guest homes only had 15-watt incandescent in room, which is not bright enough for reading. (<a href="https://www.quantumbalancing.com/worldelectricity/electricityif.htm" target="_blank">See: World Electricity Standards)</a></li>
<li>
Laundry bag. Clothes line and several eye bolts. Several small clothes pegs.</li>
<li>
Small towel. Store damp in zip lock bag in the day sack.</li>
<li>
Dual-SIM cell phone, spare battery. Purchase cheap SIM card as you enter each new country. 1.5 GHz octacore CPU or faster.</li>
<li>
A 12-inch netbook with SSD, + large external hard drive. The SSD is mandatory.</li>
<li>
A high quality, rugged backpack, only half full upon departure (see image).</li>
<li>
A rugged day sack.</li>
<li>
Convertible pants -- zip off the legs and they become shorts. Especially usefull for overly air-conditioned transportation.</li>
<li>
A bee-keepers hat to keep insects at bay while sleeping. (Mosquito netting is too bulky, and the coils are not a healthy long-term solution.) An Army-Navy store sold me the netting which I attach to a canvas safari hat.</li>
<li>
Bought a 12MP SJCam w/underwater case and spare battery for under $100 in Thailand. (Let me know if you find a cheaper underwater camera solution.)</li>
<li>
Cable ties to secure pack closures. (Slows the petty thief, not the professional.)</li></ul>

<p>============== THINGS TO LEAVE HOME ==============
<ul>
<li>
Bulky items such as sleeping bag, air mattress.</li>
<li>
Jeans, dress shirt (other than flight clothing). If needed during trip, buy.</li>
<li>
Valuables, such as expensive watches, jewelry, camera, laptop.</li>
<li>
Pots, pans, stove, fuel. (Fruit is cheap, and always in season).</li>
<li>
Travel guides with nice photos -- just too heavy. Consider Lonely Planet digital version. Truth: I'm NOT happy with performance on a cell phone. Magnification on maps is useless. Continual crashes. SLOW. No phone numbers for guest houses???? Don't want a book to tell me where to eat; DO want to know where the guest houses are located in town, prferably on a readable map!</li>
<li>
Water bottles -- just buy bottled water in size to fit the side pockets on your pack, and then refill.</li>
<li>
Deodorant, shave cream, shampoo -- use plain bar soap. Plan to shower couple times a day.</li></ul>

<p>===================== VISAs  ====================
<br>Visa requirements change: Some countries offer Visa exempt stutus to travelers from select countries -- show up at the immigration booth, your passport is examined/stamped for 14 to 60 days travel -- no cost. Other countries require many details in advance such as date of arrival. Your visa will ONLY be for that (~30 day) period starting on that date!  Fees also vary depending on passport country. Obtaining a visa in person at a counsulate may be the cheapest approach, but making a mistake or not bringing a required document can be costly. Finding a reliable visa agent may save you time, and in some rare cases, money too. 

<p>============= DISCUSSION and POINTERS =============
<br>Postage rates change: Malaysia was cheapest, now most expensive. Singapore cheapest, but Thailand fastest. 
<br>Ask for better currency exchange rates for bills and (American Express) traveler's checks of larger demonination (i.e. US $50, $100).
<br>IMPORTANT: ONLY CARRY THE MOST RECENTLY ISSUED CURRENCY! 

<p>============== THE PELNI EXPERIENCE ==============
<br>Try to obtain a Pelni Schedule before arriving in Indonesia -- most helpful for long-range planning. The schedule gives sailing times for each ship, as well as interruptions for overhaul. Pelni has a web site (<a href="http://www.pelni.co.id">www.pelni.co.id</a>) -- hopefully it will expand to show more schedule details.

<br>Their are six classes of Pelni offices; ranging from "Cabang A" which can sell tickets for any from/to destination, to "Cabang D" and "Sub Cabang" offices, which are highly restricted in the types of tickets sold.

<br>If you must travel "Ekonomi Kelas", bring food for meals or buy at snack bar on top deck, back of ship. (Food is also sold by vendors plying the decks on some journeys.)&nbsp; Bring ear plugs to use while sleeping (4 am call to prayer), and also while eating in snack bar (loud music).
If traveling alone, make friends immediately for security reasons. You can't watch your backpack while in the bathroom, sleeping, etc. Security is the single most important reason to NOT travel "Ekonomi Kelas".

<p>============== INTERNATIONAL FERRIES =============
<br>The show time is several hours before departure to facilitate passport control (and customs?). My experiences were between Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore. May have to surrender passport at the ferry office in town several hours before departure, but you are free to walk around town before (or after) it is returned to you. (Melaka, Tanjung Pinang, Dumai, Tawau experiences.)  When boarding the ferry, just a cursory look for declarations was made, except for folks obviously carrying commercial items. On the ferry, the passports were again collected for just a short time, then returned. Upon arrival at destination, the passengers just walk off the dock -- all formalities have been completed.

<p>==================== COSTS ====================
<br>After paying for round trip airfare and medical necessities, my budget was $100 per week in 1999. But costs continue to rise, and were double that in 2007. If traveling as a couple, lodging costs will only be slightly less. Update 2015/16 daily costs: Street food, $6 - $7 per day. Lodging, $10 to $18. That's close to $150/day, and does not include transportation nor admissions. 

<p>==================== ROUTINE ==================
<br>Upon arriving at a new destination, my first priority is lodging. Everything else is secondary. With cell phones, sometimes reservations can be made, even just one or two hours ahead of time, thereby saving a lot of meandering around checking availability. Down side to that philosophy is you don't get to examine the room before you book. Once your room is checked out, unload your pack and enjoy the new environment. Often I retrace my steps to get a closer look at something interesting I passed on the way to the guest house.
