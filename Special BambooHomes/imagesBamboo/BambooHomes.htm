Discussions with other travelers who had traveled extensively in the area indicated the intricate designs may be unique to Flores, the Flower Island. Nowadays, construction is generally using more durable materials such as brick and stucco, so I thought of one day returning to Flores to document this traditional art form, before it is lost to the ages. </FONT>

My path takes me <IMG SRC="imagesBamboo/DSC80344w.jpg" ALT="ConcentricDiamonds" VSPACE=9 NOSAVE BORDER=0 WIDTH=396 HEIGHT=296 align=LEFT>through Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos, and Thailand before crossing back into Indonesia from Malaysia. Whenever possible, snapshots are taken of the various bamboo panels to reinforce my befief that the intricate designs are primarily in Flores. After arrival in the port town of Ende, on the south coast of Flores, villagers directed me to the outskirts of town where several families make bamboo panels. Although different regions of the island have their own specialty, it appears that designs are only limited by the artist’s imagination.  Figures such as diamonds, steps, and squares are common, but stars, human figures, and even words are possible. Some homeowners have added color, but fortunately, this is not too common. The next five days are spent traveling across the island, taking pictures and a few videos of panel making and bamboo homes. Actually, many of the intricate designs are photographed from the bus window while traveling between the larger villages. Several representative samples are displayed below. </B></FONT>

Leaving to catch the bus back towards Bangkok the next morning, to my amazement, there stands a small shop with two designs in bamboo panels only seen in Flores. I spend a few minutes trying to find out information, but communication was impossible. Where were these panels made?  Did the artist emigrate from Flores? Why only one shop with two panels? The answers would have to wait more than two years. </B></FONT>
