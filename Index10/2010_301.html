-------------------------------------------<br>
<font size=+0><i>Decided not to risk travel to the Sinai Penninsula, and headed instead to the Red Sea coast. Marsa Alam, located some 400 km south of the tip of the Sinai, has been reported to have decent snorkling. The bus dumped us at one end of town about two hours later than advertised. Started walking to the other end where Emy Lodge is located. It's not a very large town; most extablishments are concentrated on the beach side of the main road, with generous spacing between them. </i><br>

<td><font size=+1 color="#990022">Found the Emy Lodge, and it looked inviting, yet reasonably priced. As soon as my pack was on the floor of the cabin, headed back to the office where meals coud be ordered. I'm hungry after that long bus ride accross the Arabian Desert to the coast. The meal was so good, had to stop and take a photo. </td></tr></table>

The plan is to relax and walk around town this evening, but get an early start tomorrow and check out the snorkling. Noticed some dive shops on the way in, which should be ideal for information. </td>

<td><font size=+1 color="#990022">View of the Red Sea from the common area. Snorkled paralell to the beach in three locations. All were nice, but not fantastic. Mostly hard corals and small, but colorful fish. Along the beach, most of the dive shops were closed, or the crew off on a dive boat. It may be nice to have the place to yourself, but only after you know 'where to go'.</td>
