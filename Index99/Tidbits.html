Hi Folks,
<p>This email is not newsy -- just informative. Things are going well.
Enjoy the descriptions and answers below.
<p>BAHASA INDONESIA - The official, unifying language of Indonesia, similar
to Bahasa Malay, and spoken as a second language by most Indonesians.&nbsp;
It is the primary language taught in the school system.&nbsp; The letter
"C" is pronounced like "Ch" in English.
<p><img SRC="images/FruitFest2.jpg" ALT="Fruit Baskets at Temple Await Blessing" HSPACE=4 VSPACE=2 BORDER=0 height=182 width=300 align="right">FRUIT
- Always carry fruit while traveling, as you never know when you will be
able to eat again, and it is the safest thing for a traveler to eat, provided
you peel it yourself and don't eat the skin. Papaya, banana, pineapple,
and mango often supplement my breakfast.&nbsp; But the best fruits are
described as follows:
<br><b>Durian</b> - Mellon-sized fruit with the reputation of being the
smelliest of all. See photo above.
<br><b>Manggis</b> - Mangosteen, peach-sized deep-purple fruit with cloves
of white flesh. Light flavor, yet the sweetest fruit I have ever eaten.
Caution -- the ants also love this fruit.
<br><b>Markisa</b> - Passion fruit, the size of a large lemon, with soft
edible seeds and pulp similar to pomegranate.
<br><b>Nanka</b> - Jackfruit, huge water mellon-sized fruit, flavor reminds
me of peach/pineapple/mango.
<br><b>Rambutan</b> - The hairy fruit with a texture and flavor similar
to lychee. Durable for backpacking.
<br><b>Salak</b> - Skin with scales like a snake, fruit tastes more like
a nut.&nbsp; Also very durable.
<p>FOOD - While traveling in non-western lands, it is always wise to have
no pre-conceived ideas as to the taste of familiar sounding foods. In 1967,
a hamburger in Japan tasted like meat loaf on a piece of bread. Examples
in Bali:
<br><b>Balinese curry chicken</b> - an anemic fowl, boiled in a curry sauce.
Is this the fate of the famous fighting cocks of Bali?
<br><b>Vegetable Soup</b> - clear broth with chunks of pineapple, cucumber,
tomato, and a few carrot strips.
<br><b>Pizza</b> - a rounded, flattened Italian bread dough smothered in
a watery stew of squash, tomato, bean sprout, with a few carrot and green
bean slivers.
<p>INTERNET - Indonesia style. Typical download rates, 100 bytes/sec. with
rates as low as 40 not uncommon. E-mail message through a web browser requires
6 minutes to download, on average. Folks tell me connections are faster
in Denpasar, but then that's where the demonstrations were held a few days
ago.
<p>BIRDING - Most common wild birds in Ubud, Bali, are <b>Eurasian tree
sparrow</b>, <b>spotted dove</b>, <b>island turtle-dove</b>, and <b>white
bellied swiftlet</b> circling overhead, especially in the evening. Have
also seen the <b>white egret</b>, a bird like a yellow chat, but with a
bill shaped more like that of a kingfisher (<b>olive-backed sunbird</b>),
and several mockingbird sized birds with pale yellow under rump, a tiny
brown crest, black eye patch extending to the beak, and white head (yellow-vented<b>
bulbul)</b>. Saw many swiftlets and <b>barn swallows</b> circling, even
during a rainstorm. The Pondok&nbsp;<img SRC="images/FruitFest1.jpg" ALT="Fruit and Parasols around the Alter" HSPACE=4 VSPACE=2 BORDER=0 height=188 width=300 align="left">Pekak
library offered an unusual birding opportunity, relaxing with my binoculars
and their bird book. It was here I spotted the colorful <b>Scarlet-headed
Flowerpecker, Scaly-breasted Munia,</b> and <b>Javan Munia</b>. Other birds
seen out of town are <b>White-collard kingfisher</b>, <b>Javan Kingfisher</b>,
<b>Pied
Bushchat</b>, and <b>Cattle Egret</b>. Unfortunately the best place to
see birds is in the homes of Bali, as many homeowners own a remarkable
variety of caged birds. Bali bird walk, at $33, is too rich for my budget.
<p>CEREMONIES - Saturday was a holiday in Bali, focusing on the children,
like our Halloween. Banks were open, as well as most businesses, but in
the homes and temples many ceremonies were taking place. Everyone dressed
in traditional costumes, including children of all ages. The female&nbsp;<img SRC="images/TradDress1.jpg" ALT="Traditional Dress is worn for most Ceremonies" HSPACE=4 VSPACE=2 BORDER=0 height=237 width=300 align="right">costume
consists of a solid-colored open-laced blouse, with sarong and sash. Most
women transported a fruit basket creation on their heads, and placed it
in the designated temple area for later blessing. These baskets are works
of art, some as high as six tiers of fruit. After the blessing by a priest,
the owner collects the basket and distributes the fruit for consumption
by family and friends. The male costume consists of a special extra long
white shirt/jacket, a Udang Puteh (white scarf wrapped on the head), an
inner cotton batik sarong, a Saput Kuning (outer yellow silk or rayon sarong),
with Antang (sash). Footwear on both appeared optional. I've heard conflicting
info, but this holiday appears to be based on the Hindu "knowledge and
education", as some said the same holiday is celebrated in India.
<p>BECAK - A human powered urban vehicle used as a taxi. Think of rickshaw,
or trishaw, but every town has it's own design. Some are "side-car" three
wheelers, while some are steered by grasping the passenger carriage. Nowadays,
most becak (pronounced "bechack") are peddle powered, and made from a modified
bicycle frame. Often, the owners take great pride in painting and decorating
them "distinctively".
<p>BEMO - A micro van/taxi, often too small for Western roads. But in Indonesia,
eight or more people are crammed into one, each paying the agreed upon
price. In some cities, prices are regulated, and the bemo will have a letter
or number affixed designating the route he will follow. These are the safest
ones for travel, as the price is fixed. But in other cities, the driver
has the freedom to go anywhere, and charge anything, so you must negotiate
the fare before entering. It helps to speak a few key words of the language,
and to hone your bargaining skills.
<p>GEKKO - Gecko, a neat little lizard with suction cups on the toes, seen
especially in the evenings running across ceilings and walls to catch flies,
moths, mosquitoes, etc. This sound may be heard a few times an hour throughout
Southeast Asia.  <audio controls>

<p>MANDI: Southeast Asian method of taking a bath, by squatting near a
floor drain and pouring water over oneself from a reservoir, by the same
name. It may look like a bath tub, but is your only source of fresh water
-- don't contaminate it. Often, the mandi and toilet are in the same room.
