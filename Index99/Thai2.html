Hi Folks,
<p><img SRC="images/SaveCoralSign.jpg" ALT="Lip service." HSPACE=2 VSPACE=2 border=1 NOSAVE height=310 width=231 align=LEFT>After breakfast in Hat Yai, Thailand, the Tourist Information Office was only
a short walk, to plan onward transportation. They recommend only the west
coast for beaches and snorkeling, because monsoon now on East coast. I
show them the Lonely Planet guide that says East coast is preferred at
this time of year, and they say the book is wrong. I decide to try them
both, and find out for sure.
<p>Wanting to avoid an arrival after 6 PM at night (in this case after
midnight), requires me to spend one more night in Hat Yai, so I check back
into the same dorm room, wash my clothes, and head out for lunch. A spinach
dish, green bean dish, yellow crunchy vegetable dish, and a broccoli one.
Only one is spicy, and all are delicious with the ubiquitous Thai rice.
A Pepsi brings the bill to $1. An observation is that people here eat with
fork in right hand, spoon in left hand, quite contrary to Indonesia and
Malaysia, where custom dictates the left hand never be brought near food.
I look forward to meal-time, as the food has been most enjoyable.
<p><img SRC="images/KoSamuiBound.jpg" ALT="Ferry to Ko Samui in the Rainy Season" VSPACE=1 NOSAVE BORDER=1 height=174 width=438 align=RIGHT>Now
it's time to see some temples. Several of us use local transportation to
the third largest lying Buddha image in Thailand. I’m not impressed, partially
because the temple is still under construction and parts of it are covered
in dust. We can imagine where some of the carvings, setting around the
temple, will be placed as the temple nears completion. We take a few pictures,
and head back to the dorm. Time to read more about the east and west coast
islands.
<br><img SRC="images/KoSamuiFerry.gif" ALT="Ferry Ticket" VSPACE=1 NOSAVE BORDER=0 height=138 width=101 align=LEFT>
<br>Got an early start for Ko Samui on a big bus, after taking local transportation
to the station. One ticket includes bus + ferry + bus transportation to
destination. It’s windy, but the boat trip is uneventful. Talk to an Aussie
that has lived here many years, and is just returning from the monthly
required round trip out of country, to get visa re-newed. He is quite helpful
with climate info, telling me this is the wrong time and place for snorkeling.
He recommends lodging for the night, and also explains the best way to
the west coast. Between showers, I try some body-surfing, walk around town,
and play the fiddle. Then it's time to check out of the straw hut, and
make way back to&nbsp;<img SRC="images/KrabiRaceDay.jpg" ALT="Crowds of well wishers cheer their teams" HSPACE=1 VSPACE=5 NOSAVE BORDER=1 height=280 width=373 align=RIGHT>the
ferry side of the island. The ferry is a small boat, so I understand why
the trip is sometimes canceled in rough weather. The ticket seller assumes
all passengers want the upper deck, complete with mattress for the night-time
crossing. The boat is less than half full. My worries about rough weather
in such a small boat are not tested, as the winds die down.
<p>On to Krabi, the jumping off place for the Ko Phi Phi National Park.
People tell me a big Hollywood movie has just been made here, and that
the place will be famous overnight. As I arrive in town, I see boat races
and picnics -- it's obviously some sort of holiday. Great time to take
pictures of the people. Can’t find information about places to snorkel,
so I sign up for a "4 island&nbsp;<img SRC="images/PhotoFinish.jpg" ALT="Photo Finish!" VSPACE=6 NOSAVE BORDER=1 height=193 width=300 align=LEFT>snorkeling
trip" for the next morning.
<p>On a scale of one to ten, I put the tour at a three. The boat pulls
up to an island, tosses the anchor out onto the coral, and says we leave
in two hours. No provisions for changing into bathing suit, so into the
bushes I go, being very careful where I step. (People normally go into
the bushes for something else.) Of the 13 on the tour, I’m the first in
the water, and can’t find much alive. Shortly before we leave, a huge school
of large (~two pound) colorful fish swim by. Much of the coral is damaged,
about a hundred yards off-shore. This experience does not compare to&nbsp;
the earlier Bali trip. The next several stops are not much better. At one
of the places we swim among colorful white and yellow stripped fish.&nbsp;<img SRC="images/CamelR.jpg" ALT="Camel Rock, between Krabi and Ko Phi Phi" VSPACE=2 NOSAVE BORDER=1 height=221 width=319 align=RIGHT>The
tour passes by many limestone formations with unusual shapes. Camel Rock
is a natural. The last place has shallow caves on the island, which are
fun to explore, but masses of tourists are everywhere you look.
<p>Accommodations on this peninsula, accessible only by boat, vary from
100 baht to 25,000 baht per night, and attempts are made to keep riffraff
(such as us) away from the folks that pay 25,000 baht, with guards and
gated villas. Lots of monkeys on the paths by the caves; they think every
plastic bag contains food. They leave me alone, as I have no bags with
me, but that is not the case with many around me. These monkeys are rather aggressive.
<p><img SRC="images/Formation2.jpg" ALT="Limstone formations undercut at the waterline." VSPACE=4 NOSAVE BORDER=1 height=203 width=319 align=LEFT>In
general, I find the tourist places to be much too touristic, so decide
to remain in the town of Krabi. I extend my stay here for the holiday on
the 22nd -- the last full moon of the Thai year, and it appears to be a
rather festive occasion. But now it’s time to rent a bicycle, and ride
into the countryside with camera, in an attempt to capture more sights
of Thailand.
