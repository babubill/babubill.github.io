<td VALIGN=TOP>Hi folks,
<p>The last full day in Thailand started with a stroll through Krabi, breakfast
at the market, and a stop at an Internet caf&eacute; where the Thai2 newsletter
was written. Lunch consisted of Roti with Curry, lots of papaya, and a
few mangosteins. The bookstore did not want to rent out a bike because
of the Loy Krathong holiday, but the Mountain Bike Shop was happy to take
50 baht for 6 hours. Even though Krabi is the size of a small town, it
is the seat of the provincial government, and a focal point for the New
Years celebration, with all the noise, commotion, and traffic one would
expect when the population expands 10-fold for the festivities.&nbsp;
<p>The ride out of town leaves it all behind. Investigating a few side
roads along the way, I finally head for a National Park and waterfall some
20 KM away, as just enough signage is in roman characters to follow the
crude map. About 7 KM out of town, on the road, which ends at the park,
two students point me towards the detour around a washed out bridge. This
path takes me across a small bridge only wide enough for motorbikes to
cross in one direction at a time. This confirms earlier information that
"you can't take car - you must rent motorbike." The mountain bike is perfect
in every respect.
<p>The road winds along small rubber tree, palm oil, and fruit tree plantations,
with a generous number of coconut palms, banana, and papaya trees planted
wherever a shack or living quarter is seen. I take pictures of many of
these sights, including those I don't quite understand. When I stop to
take a picture of a rack of poles filled with off-white mats set out to
dry, a farmer, probably in his fifties, invites me in for a drink. I graciously
refuse, but confirm these latex like mats are one of the stages in rubber
production. Now if only I could remember that film clip from elementary
school which explained the rubber making process in SE Asia . . .
<p>Many of the oil palm trees have fern like plants, and occasionally orchids,
growing from the trunks, sometimes all the way up to the palm leaves. Some
of the rubber tree cups are full, others are empty, and some of the rubber
tree plantations appear abandoned. One of the palm trees has a string of
green, golf ball sized fruit growing around the trunk. The palms are shorter
on these trees than on coconut palms. The jackfruit grows on a tree similar
in appearance to a southern magnolia. As this is the start of the dry season,
only notice about 15 or 20 plants in bloom. Just imagine what it must be
like at the start of the rainy season!
<p>This part of Thailand is known for the many strange limestone outcroppings,
in otherwise rather flat terrain. These outcroppings may tower up to 1000
feet, with walls so shear, little vegetation can get a foothold. The tops
of the formations are heavily forested, but the lack of huge trees tells
me they are probably not virgin forests. Caves with large openings are
abundant, with many of the stalactites and stalagmites visible from outside
the caves. My road passes by several typical outcroppings.
<p>As I bike along the road, everyone you pass either on motor bike, standing
near the road's edge, or at the many gathering places, smiles and calls
out "hello." When I wave at an oncoming motorbike containing one to four
people, they smile back and toot the horn in acknowledgment. And I feel
sad I have only spent a week in Thailand. At a crossroad store next to
a police station, I stop for a snack and cold drink. They tell me it's
9 KM to the beautiful park, but are rather pre-occupied making float boats
to sell for the big celebration in Krabi tonight. These are slices of Banana
plant stalks dressed in banana leaf, flowers, candle, and of course the
required incense sticks. I will buy one that evening for 20 baht, add two
sparklers, and send it off downstream and out to sea with my troubles of
the past year. What a great concept!
<p>Another 4 or 5 KM down the road, I notice the hills in the distance
are covered in dark clouds. This is not a good sign, but I push onwards.
When the wind kicks up, the hills are totally obscured, so I turn the bike
around, probably 2 KM short of the park. It's only 3:30, but already I've
had a wonderful day, and the cool tailwind is refreshing.
<p>Arriving back in Krabi, the traffic is backed up for miles. No rain
has fallen to dampen the festivities. When I can't ride the bike, I pick
it up and carry it through the crowds, making my way towards the center
of town. The road has been blocked for a parade in progress, complete with
floats, marching bands, Thai dancers, and representatives from 6 countries:
China, Russia, Yugoslavia, Japan, Israel, and Italy. After returning the
bike to the now closed shop, showering, and eating dinner, travel plans
are finalized with payment of bus fare to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Now it's
time to re-join the Loy Krathong celebration, and make my way down towards
the dance stage.
<p>May be awhile before I have access again. Don't give up . . . .
<p>Bill
