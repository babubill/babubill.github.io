Hi Folks,
<p>Writing you from Kota Bharu (Baru), on the east coast of Malaysia, ready
to pass into Thailand tomorrow. The boats have stopped running to the gorgeous
island of Pulau Perhentian, in the South China Seas because the monsoon
season is upon us. This is the island with just a few straw huts, that
was perfect for a retreat 7 years ago, and it just seemed to be an ideal
place to be alone for awhile, study, and play my fiddle. Well, it is now
one of the biggest attractions on the east coast, and loaded with upscale
resorts. So much for the ambiance of "no electricity" and drawing one's
own water with a bucket from the well!
<p><img SRC="images/NightMarket.jpg" ALT="Night Market creations" VSPACE=4 NOSAVE BORDER=0 height=190 width=292 align=LEFT>Two
attractions in Kota Bharu I missed on my first trip are the markets. The
photo above was taken from the second floor balcony of a three-story market,
conveniently&nbsp; lit by the sun shining through the glass domed roof.
The central area was dominated by produce vendors. Other areas of the first
floor specialized in dried food, fresh fish, poultry, meat, and even prepared
meals, but mostly food items. Dried goods, clothing, and household items
were located on the second and third floors. The other market I missed
was a parking lot by day, but a Night Market for several hours each evening.
It seems the whole town shows up to patronize the food stalls, where delicious
creations materialize before your eyes.
<p><img SRC="images/KBNightMarket.jpg" ALT="Rotate Monitor 45 degrees clockwise for best Viewing" VSPACE=4 NOSAVE BORDER=0 height=256 width=357 align=RIGHT>Thailand
will be a new country for me. My plans are to stay in Southern Thailand
for a week or so, then work back down the west coast of the peninsula to
Melaka, Malaysia, where I will cross back into Indonesia about Thanksgiving.
<p>One of the interesting travelers I met, an author from Japan, wrote
a sensational book 16 years ago about being a "house husband" in Japan.
Neat guy -- will try to keep in touch by email. Another author, a Spaniard,
walked the total length of the Andes in South America, as mentioned in
the last newsletter. These are the types of people you meet by shunning
the private rooms and hotels, in favor of the cheaper "dormitory" lodgings.
The typical dorm has sleeping space for 2 to 12 folks per room. The nicer
ones give each dormer a key, but others have less security, meaning you
have to keep your valuables on you at all times. Some have limited cooking
facilities, but most have a common area where you gather with other travelers
and swap stories. While riding on the jungle train from Mela to Kota Bharu,
I ran into the first Americans I've seen since Bali. Two lawyers, both
ladies, on a three week holiday, also trying to go to the Perhentian Islands.
I wished them luck.
<p><img SRC="images/TreeTop.jpg" ALT="A tree is home to many plants ...." VSPACE=4 NOSAVE height=192 width=295 align=LEFT>Surprisingly,
I don't miss contra dancing. Guess meeting all the new folks, hiking, and
jungle trekking gets my mind worlds away. I worry instead about mosquitoes,
leaches, getting sick, or twisting a muscle, the latter two of which have
not happened. On average, one can expect to be sick one or two days a month
while traveling like this, so I must be doing something right. Like last
night I had water buffalo meat for dinner with noodles and vegetables.
A very dark, tough, but tasty meat.
<p>Well, got to get back to the dorm and plan the next leg of the journey.
Keep the Email coming, (w.a.ossa@bigfoot.com) but please forgive me if
the answers are incorporated in the Trav-E-logs.
