Hi folks,
<p>I'm finally back in touch with the world. It's been great, and long,
so I have to send several episodes over the next few days. Here goes .
. . .
<p>Typical locations for intercity bus terminals and stations in Indonesia
are on the outskirts of towns and cities, and Makasar is no exception.
So hopped a bemo* to "city center" for 500 rupia, plus a similar amount
for my pack, which takes the space of one passenger. When the driver asked
me which street, after we had traveled a few kilometers, he raised the
price to 20,000 rupia to my response. I figured the markings on my map
were correct for "city center", but where he took me was much larger and
livelier than the "central Market" close to my hotel. We finally agreed
on 7000 rupia, and he delivered me to the front door, several km further
away from his city center. Tired, dirty, and hungry again, I removed my
shoes, climbed the two flights of stairs to the dorm, plopped my valuables
in a locker, unpacked down to a clean change of clothes, and hit the mandi*.
<p>Wearing a fresh change of clothes, I check to see if anyone is ready
for dinner. Nope, so out the door I go and find a packed place, without
sign or name. That is a very good sign, so I enter and order the cumi-cumi
(squid), and it is served with lots of cooked vegetables. They are all
out of Coke and try to substitute milk tea, which I refuse. Now that the
stomach is satisfied, it's back to the hotel, talk to some folks I saw
briefly in the Togian Islands, excuse myself and fall asleep under the
supplied mosquito net. At 8 AM the next morning, it is a brisk walk to
the Pelni office, where quite a crowd has gathered around the sales counter.
Does not look good, so I head up the stairs to the offices.&nbsp; There
I'm told to take the elevator to "D", to buy my ticket. The elevator doors
open into an office area, and I'm directed to the backside of the sales
counter, where 60 or so would-be purchasers are amassed at the front side.
The Pelni clerk invites me to sit down, while she finishes the transaction
in progress. It's air conditioned on this side of the counter, so I sit
and glance around the office. She asks what she can do for me, and I answer
with "Is that a picture of your baby?" "Yes, he's 10 months old." I ask
for a ticket on the Awu to Maumere, Flores, and she asks me what class.
"2nd." "123,500 Rupia." Suddenly, I have a 2nd class ticket on a ship that
was sold out 10 days earlier. Sometimes it pays to shun the tee, for a
shirt with collar. On the way back to the hotel, I stop at the post office
and send out the Trav-E-Log composed in Poso. Lots of e-mail -- thanks
to all for your kind words. I owe tons of replies; thanks for your patience.
<p><img SRC="images/TorajaRecess.jpg" ALT="Children at play in the church-school yard, Rantepao." VSPACE=4 height=236 width=350 align="right">While
traveling in foreign countries, we always seek out and photograph unusual
sights. But it's also fun to see just how much folks are the same, the
world over. While walking around Rantepao, children's laughter could be
heard coming from a church-school playground. Peaking through the gate,
I saw "Simon says", Tana Toraja style. Fortunately I was able to snap this
picture before they observed the observer.
<p>*MANDI: Southeast Asian method of taking a bath, by squatting near a
floor drain and pouring water over oneself from a reservoir, by the same
name. It may look like a bath tub, but is your only source of fresh water
-- don't contaminate it. Often, the mandi and toilet are in the same room.
<p>*BEMO: A micro van/bus that travels along a city street, looking for
passengers. These tiny vans will try to jam up to 14 paying fares into
them at one time. As one approaches, you call out your destination, and
if the driver nods, you jump in. Most cities have fixed prices, along certain
routes, but to be safe, tell the driver how much you expect to pay.
