. . on the cheapest RT ticket ($590) to Indonesia or Malaysia I could find
in several weeks of searching newspapers and the Internet. I'm prepared
for cattle car treatment, which is reinforced when calling to reserve seat
selection, and China Airlines tells me only first and business class passengers
can reserve seat assignments ahead of time. So . . . arrived at LAX at
9:45 PM on Friday in a major traffic jam caused by the shear volume of
travelers. Only 3 or 4 passengers in front of me at the China Airlines
check in, and the line moves rapidly. The attendant insists the backpack
be checked. At 40 pounds, I'm relieved at the loss in weight, but worried
by the loss in control. Guess it didn't make sense to try and dance in
South Pasadena on the way to the airport. I walk away from the counter
with my hip sack around my waist, and fiddle at my side, noting how efficiently
the check-in counter is operating. With 2 1/2 hours to kill, I sit down
on the floor near an elevator and fiddle for an&nbsp;<img SRC="images/BaliTaxi.jpg" ALT="$10 taxi ride to Ubud" VSPACE=4 NOSAVE BORDER=0 height=288 width=214 align=LEFT>hour
and a half. The image of someone sitting and fiddling at the airport was
too much for some passersby - a few came over to look into the open fiddle
case. After closing it, some became more perplexed. So I install the mute.
Muffled, yes, but the sound is music to my ears . . . .
<p>At 30 minutes past midnight, all passengers are quickly loaded onto
a tram, and driven to a waiting 747-400. I see a staff of over 20 embark
on the airplane, and it turns out to be only 85% booked. The flight leaves
the gate and is airborne at the scheduled time of 1:15 AM Saturday morning.
Nicest flight I have ever experienced, bar none. Three movies, two full
meals, wine, brandy, and continuous drink service, all complimentary. Passengers
are encouraged to use the "call" button. Slippers, toothbrush, and lotion.
The crew is even kind enough to supply a shaver, normally reserved only
for "front section" passengers. There is an empty seat between my window
assignment and the isle passenger, who gives me my first self-directed
Indonesian language lesson. I get some semblance of sleep - possibly 3
hours, as I feel totally refreshed upon arrival in Taiwan. The 3 hour layover
in Taipei permits more fiddle practice, and I keep running into a Japanese
family returning from a 2 month stay in the USA and Canada. We exchange
addresses. The 2nd leg to Denpasar is as pleasant as the first, arriving
in Bali on schedule.
<p><img SRC="images/BaliHouse1.jpg" ALT="Sitting and dining area is typically on porch of homestay." HSPACE=4 VSPACE=2 NOSAVE BORDER=0 height=196 width=300 align=LEFT>Arriving
at the passport control desk, the agent asks to see my ticket for leaving
country within 60 days. I show him my return ticket -- 97 days away. He
says "This is problem." My explanation that the Indonesian Consulate in
Los Angeles said, 'no problem, just leave the country before 60 days, and
return for another 60 day visa,' falls on deaf ears. The agent says for
US$ 20, he will fix problem. Setting my wallet on the counter bothers him,
and he tells me to hide it. I only have $12 in small bills, and he says
"no problem". Fifty eight years old, and now I start bribing government
officials!
<p><img SRC="images/BaliYard1.jpg" ALT="View from porch while eating breakfast." HSPACE=4 VSPACE=2 NOSAVE height=196 width=300 align=RIGHT>After
an exorbitant taxi ride to Ubud (65,000 Rupia to get there, but only 12,000
Rupia to return), found a place close to the one I stayed in seven years
ago. The best part about this location is its proximity to everything that's
happening. A quick clothes change, and it's off to the Tourist Information
Office. Almost the first foreigner I run into has a startling resemblance
to someone I think I know, so I ask him if he knows me. His accent is American.
<i>Where you from</i> -- East coast --<i>where?</i> -- was Philly for 2
1/2 years, Hampton Roads before that -- <i>no deal, I lived in Takoma Park.</i>
You a Contra dancer? <i>YES -- GLEN ECHO! -- BUFFALO GAP</i> --!!!!!!!!!!!
Jim Avery, now living in New Mexico. What a small world -- I seem to recall
he was one of the first guys I saw wearing a skirt at Buffalo Gap, when
the art of contra dancing was a totally new experience.
<p>What IS that funny sound you hear in the evenings? I feel re-assured while lying in bed, knowing it's presence will help me sleep. <embed src="sounds/Gekko1.wav" controls=smallconsole width=51 height=20 autostart=true loop=false></embed><bgsound="Gekko1.wav">
<p>My first taste of Indonesia was only for two weeks, and restricted to Bali and Java. Now I've returned after seven years, ready to start an adventure of a lifetime.
