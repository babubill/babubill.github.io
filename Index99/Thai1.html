Hi Folks,
<p>Got an early morning start in Kota Bharu and walked the 1 km to the
big bus station, as no rickshaw was in sight. While walking through the
crowd of taxi drivers around the station, they offered a taxi ride "because
you must wait more than one hour for the bus". After checking the signs
for Bus #29, you find it is only a 15 minute wait, and you have your choice
of any seat on the bus. I always like the first seat opposite the driver
because it has the best visibility. The fare is $0.71 for the 1 hour ride.
The bus drops me off at Rantau Banjang - right in front of the border control
station. After getting passport exit stamped, the 100 meter walk across
the bridge reminds me of walking across the Rio Grande into Mexico. The
center of the span is marked by plaques in 3 languages (English is in the
middle), noting the cooperation of the two friendly governments. Will this
be the Rosetta stone in the 40th century A.D? The&nbsp;<img SRC="images/LgLeafFruit2.jpg" ALT="Great vegitation!" VSPACE=4 height=240 width=319 align="Left">Thai
authorities give me a 30 day visa stamp (free), and direct me towards the
train station, 800 meters away, to buy Baht. It's a long, hot walk. I can't
believe someone hasn't established an exchange kiosk within 50 meters of
the border. But this is Sungai Kolok, Thailand, not exactly a thriving
metropolis like Hat Yai (HatJai) or Bangkok.
<p>The ride along the shore is noted to be a more scenic route to my next
destination, so I try to find the station for Hat Yai bound buses after
cashing a traveler's check for Baht. Finally find someone that speaks a
few words of English, and she tells me the next bus is a 3.5 hour wait,
and arrives at Hat Yai very late at night. So I rush the one and a half
miles back to the train station to find that the next reasonable train
leaves in 1-1/2 hours, as the 12 o'clock train now leaves at 11, and I
missed it by 1 hour. Only junk food vendors in sight, so I buy a variety
of too-sweet local pastries, and make do. Watching other trains load is
quit an education in efficiency. Laborers carry huge loads on their shoulders
up to the train window, pass it through to the other side, where another
takes it to the next train over. This even happens while the trains are
moving through the station! Westerners are so inefficient!
<p><img SRC="images/FlowerPath.jpg" ALT="The flowers on this plant are like little bottle brushes ..." VSPACE=4 BORDER=0 height=229 width=319 align="right">During
the pleasant, 3-1/2 hour train ride, noted many cattle egrets, blue iridescent
kingfishers, farmers planting rice, a bittern, many, many rubber tree plantations,
and a crow-like bird with wings the color of a female robin's breast. Also
a huge pink flower, possibly a lotus in bloom.
<p>In Hat Yai, I walk to the Cathy guesthouse, listed in the Lonely Planet
Guide, and it's a winner. The dorm is spacious, with only three beds. For
dinner it's down to a large grouping of food vendors, and the smells are
heavenly. Four skewers, 2 types of eggroll, Thai rice, and a bottle of
Sprite for $1.65. On the way back, I buy a Thai souvenir tee. She started
the bartering at $5.25, but when the price dropped to $2.10, I couldn't
pass up the bargain.
<p>Well, they are kicking me out as the shop is closing. Will have to finish
the Thai episode later.
