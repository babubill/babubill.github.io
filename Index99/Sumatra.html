Hi folks,
<p><img SRC="images/Equator1.jpg" ALT="Monument marking the equator between Bukittinggi and Pekanbaru" VSPACE=4 NOSAVE height=213 width=310 align=RIGHT>Sorry
for the long delay, but local connections are sparse, and expensive in
the towns I have visited.
<p>Sumatra has been a great place, with wonderful people. Upon arrival
in Dumai (from Melaka, Malaysia), I hooked up with a Japanese &amp; Italian
traveling pair, and we headed to Bukittinggi, only stopping at Pekanbaru
overnight to break the long journey. The dorm room here is very small,
but the price is right -- $1. a night. And the staff and family have been
fun to talk to, and have also been very helpful. The amazing thing is that
people are so friendly, even when not trying to sell you something. Unlike
many other places, the merchants seem to be more interested in greeting
you than in trying to make a quick sale. And I haven't had to haggle over&nbsp;<img SRC="images/BukitMusic.jpg" ALT="Traditional performances" VSPACE=2 NOSAVE BORDER=0 height=216 width=350 align=LEFT>prices,
as even the locals say they pay the same prices for the items I am buying.
What a pleasant difference from most other places. I hope I don't lose
my touch.
<p>The Lonely Planet Guide suggested a half-day walking tour of town that
was a nice way to become familiar with Minangkabau attractions and culture.
Unfortunately, the path across the suspended bridge requires that you travel
through the zoo, which is in deplorable condition.
<p><img SRC="images/MaturNaomi.jpg" ALT="Poinsettias before the rain ...." VSPACE=2 NOSAVE BORDER=0 height=217 width=310 align=RIGHT>The
first evening I attended a traditional song, dance, and martial arts performance,
and fell in love with the music. One of the reed instruments (serunai)
sounded like the bombard(?) David Cantieni of Wild Asparagus plays, which
I thought came from North Africa. Drums, gongs, flutes, and recorders were
also used. All during the performance, I kept thinking of Ruth and Bob,
and all the performers with Mixed Pickles. (Yeah, I still miss you!) After
the performance, I went up to the master musician, Fendra Kasaef, and asked
him if we could get together and try something with my fiddle. He suggested
meeting there at 8 PM the next evening, and I agreed, but told him of my
plans to go on a bus trip and that I would try, but no promises.
<p><img SRC="images/Lawang.jpg" ALT="Bukit Lawang rest stop" VSPACE=2 NOSAVE BORDER=0 height=257 width=310 align=LEFT>The
next day was a trip to Maninjau, a nearby mountain lake, where two of us
trekked down to the lake from the mountain top. Altogether it was about
7 hours of walking, 4 of it going downhill in the jungle after a heavy
rainstorm. Those in the know, realize what this means. Leaches everywhere,
and if you stopped to empty them from your shoes, more would climb on you
almost as fast as you could remove them. These were similar to the black
leeches at the National Park in Malaysia, but with a color change to brown.
The really bad part about trekking downhill after a rainstorm is that the
path is unbelievably slippery, requiring you to watch every step you take,
and so have less time to "smell the roses" and "see the forest". I stumbled
three times, but my partner actually fell down. Couldn't believe we didn't
have the suckers from head to toe after that episode. But the view&nbsp;<img SRC="images/FisherMananjau.jpg" ALT="Fisherman preparing to set out his net in Lake Maninjau." VSPACE=1 NOSAVE height=173 width=310 align=RIGHT>was
lovely, and it felt good to do that much hiking in one day. Upon reaching
the lake, we stopped at a guesthouse overlooking the lake, had tea and
a snack, used the facilities, and caught the next bus back to Bukittinggi.
What a trip! Being a Sunday, many were out for the day, and we were the
70th or so riders on a 30-seater. Up to six of us were hanging on from
our perch on the steps, outside the bus door! We managed to push our way
into the bus during the next 3 miles or so, for the 2-hour trip back to
town. Fortunately, we were inside when it decided to rain again, but some
got off the bus, as it was just too cold hanging on. We stayed on the bus,
and began to breathe easier once a few passengers started getting off.
<p><img SRC="images/FendraFiddle.jpg" ALT="Master musicians at work ..." VSPACE=2 NOSAVE height=184 width=310 align=RIGHT>Arrived
home at 7 PM, just in time to bathe and rest a few moments before going
back to the to the traditional song, and dance hall meeting place. Upon
approaching the building, the sound of a guitar told me he was waiting.
The next hour and a half were productive, figuring out the key to which
the gongs (Talempong) were tuned, tuning my fiddle to F-C-G-D, and trying
some simple tunes. Three of us continued the following evening as well,
spending some time trying to play the gongs, and fiddle, rather successfully.
Also purchased a 5-tone, 4-hole traditional instrument (serunai) from Fendra
for his asking price of about $5. The instrument is&nbsp;<img SRC="images/Hornbill.jpg" ALT="Hornbill in the Bukittinggi Zoo" HSPACE=2 VSPACE=0 NOSAVE BORDER=0 height=163 width=78 align=LEFT>made of Buffalo horn, and bamboo, with a reed that is almost swallowed when
you play it. Really a wild sound! Fendra stressed that this is a playing
quality instrument, not just a souvenir. He described the difference as
being in the placement of the holes, and the ratio of hole position to
diameter.
<p>Well, next I want to head to Lake Toba, and meet with the Batak people,
who are also very much into music and dance. Hope you all had a great Thanksgiving.
