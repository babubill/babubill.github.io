Hi folks,
<p><img SRC="images/BaliPerformance.jpg" ALT="Another evening performance in Ubud." VSPACE=1 NOSAVE height=187 width=310 align=RIGHT>Just
one chapter this time, and the next will probably be from the USA. Thanks
to all for putting up with the poor spelling, grammar, etc. When I have
more time, I would like to clean up things, and place on a web site, with
photos of the trip. More later . . . .
<p>It's now been a week since returning to Bali. The weather has been much
better than expected - the sun has been out at least part of every day,
with no more than a few hours of rain during some afternoons or evenings.
Like every other place in Indonesia, get up at the crack of dawn so you
can enjoy the clear, cool mornings.
<p><img SRC="images/Per4merBlessn.jpg" ALT="Blessing the Kecak performers." VSPACE=1 NOSAVE height=221 width=404 align=LEFT>The
days have been filled with shopping, walking, biking, and writing, while
attending several performances in the evenings. Kutut, the Hai Home Stay
manager and all around worker, invited me to join his family in celebrating
Kuningan, when ancestors are bid farewell. Dressed in ceremonial garb,
prayers are said Hindu style, at the family temple, as well as at a few
local temples. In our case, we visited the moon temple, and the elephant
cave temple, both well known in Bali.
<p><img SRC="images/FuneralProcess.jpg" ALT="Funeral Procession in Ubud." VSPACE=5 NOSAVE BORDER=1 height=324 width=400 align=RIGHT>I
also spent the better part of one day viewing a cremation ceremony for
a rather important person, right here in Ubud. Most of the town went without
electricity for 4 to 5 hours, as the overhead power lines along the route
were disconnected to make way for the tower carried in the funeral procession.
Although the cremation rituals last many days, the highly festive procession
to the cemetery and burning of the corpse is the part most often seen by
tourists. Shortly after noon, the procession consisting of many hundreds
of people carrying musical instruments, offerings, ritual objects, a huge
multi-tiered tower, and a person riding a sarcophagus in the shape of a
huge bull, got underway. Elaborate bamboo structures were required to carry
the later two items. The procession started at the football field, traveled
up&nbsp;<img SRC="images/FuneralPyre.jpg" ALT="Both bull containing body, and nine-tiered tower are burned." VSPACE=1 NOSAVE BORDER=1 height=374 width=430 align=LEFT>Monkey
Forest Road to the main road, turned right past the market, and finally
turned right again into the temple grounds by the bus station. The gathering
now contains several thousand people. In the huge field by the meeting
halls, the bull was placed in an open sided, covered structure, built on
a platform. The back of the bull was pried open to gain access to the body
cavity, into which many items were placed, including the contents of a
wooden coffin, draped with a white cloth. Some of the items were ceremoniously
carried around the platform three times, as was the coffin after removing
from the tower. Other items removed or released from the tower included
two doves, a portrait of the deceased, jars, and many items I could not
identify. Sod was placed, grass side down, around the platform to protect
from the flames. Both the bull&nbsp;<img SRC="images/UbudMarket1.jpg" ALT="Ubud market.  White tarp in lower corner is sun screen." VSPACE=3 NOSAVE BORDER=1 height=350 width=283 align=RIGHT>and
the tower were set afire. Although I was able to get some photos of the
procession, my camera decided to join the deceased during the festivities.
Oh well, almost eight years old.
<p>I also run into the Canadians again, Matt and Chris, who tell me they
(and Jesper) left Lombok when things got ugly. Rumors are flying around
that several Christian Indonesians were killed in Lombok a few days earlier.
<p>One evening I sat down at a local warung (neighborhood restaurant),
and struck up a conversation with the fellow next to me. He appeared young,
but probably in his early thirties, and on his first trip to Bali from
Japan. We both were thinking of biking the countryside the following day,
so met at 9 AM the next morning, and headed north, after spending 30 minutes
performing maintenance on the rental bikes. After eating lunch, we decided
to try to bike up to Gunung Kawi, as long as the weather held out. It is
so nice to ride along the backcountry roads, where life is not too heavily
influenced by the tourists. Mr. Takt was still very interested in the many
craft items for sale when our back roads ended and we had to bike along
the highway. He did a fine job resisting temptation, and&nbsp;<img SRC="images/UbudMarket2.jpg" ALT="The central Ubud Market.  Know your prices before you go!" VSPACE=1 NOSAVE height=258 width=387 align=LEFT>bartered
like a pro during the few times he saw something he really wanted. In some
places the road was steep enough that we dismounted and walked the bikes.
At close to 3 PM, we decided it was time to start back home to avoid being
caught by darkness. Now it was all downhill, and even though we stopped
at a few more places, made it to Ubud by 4:30 PM. We decided to sit down
for a bite to eat and sort out expenses. I had tentative plans to try and
meet Colin and Hilda for dinner, so only wanted a small snack to hold me
over.
<p><img SRC="images/PuriLempad.gif" ALT="Legendary Lempad Art Work" VSPACE=2 NOSAVE BORDER=0 height=257 width=162 align=RIGHT>By 6 PM, we turned the bikes in and bid each other happy traveling. Walked up and down the streets of Ubud, finally gave up on finding Colin and Hilda.
Close to home, at 7:30, in front of a performance hall, I hear "Hi Bill."
I still have chain oil on my calves from the bicycle, so take a 5 minute
detour to wash my legs. The stars are out, so decide to take nothing but
my wallet, flashlight, and insect repellent to dinner. We select the garden
setting of an up-scale restaurant, overlooking a rural area of Ubud. For
our light meal, we order soup, salad, and drink. Mine is served in a scooped
out pineapple shell, with lots of coconut shavings on top. I'm going to
miss this food. As we eat, it starts to rain lightly, so we move under
the roof, reminiscing about our 5 days together, and future plans. As we
pay our bills and say our final good-byes, the stars are out again.

<p>Back Soon! Save me a dance!
