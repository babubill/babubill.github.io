Hi Folks,
<p>Three messages are being sent today, so please read them in the proper
order. First read "Sulawesi", then this one, "Pelni Again", and lastly
"Flores". THIS IS the 2nd. message, Pelni Again. Note the phonetic spelling
of some words below.
<p>Second kelas on a Pelni ship is worlds different from ekonomi kelas.
The latter also serves breakfast: Tasteless rice slopped on an aluminum
try, and a hard boiled egg if you are lucky. No eating utensils, no chair,
no table, no bench, nothing. Find a place to sit on the deck, which is
littered with garbage, and consume. Second kelas, on the other hand, is
served meals with tablecloths, napkins, condiments, bread and water, everything
you would expect in a western restaurant. The noon meal even had entertainment
-- a small band with singer. Other second kelas benefits include your own
bunk in a room shared with 3 others, a locker with lock and key for your
backpack, travel sack, and shoes, and a hallway not filled with garbage.
But the best part of traveling one class above ekonomi is in the bathroom.
On the other five days and four nights aboard a Pelni ship, I could not
enter a bathroom without wading in liquid, about 1" deep. This liquid was
emanating from urinals, showers, and wash basins. Only the hot water plumbing
worked, which was scalding in the wash basin, but very warm in the other
locations. The semi-private bath in second kelas, it turned out, had a
similar plumbing problem on the sink, but as most of the drains worked,
the floor remained reasonably clean and dry. The showers felt heavenly,
and in almost clean surroundings, were among the best since leaving Los
Angles.
<p>Unlike my other Pelni experiences, this crossing was made talking to
Westerners. Chris and Matt are from Canada, Jesper from Denmark, and Robert
from England. We all met in Makasar at the Legends Hostel, all want to
go to Flores, and all are thinking that seeing the famous 3-colored lakes
of Kelimutu on the first dawn of 2000 might be an appropriate way to start
Y2K. Blond hair on a 6'+ frame means it is somewhat easy to spot Chris
in a crowd of Indonesians. We agree to meet by finding Chris at the port
in Maumere, Flores.
